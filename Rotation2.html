<h1>Rotation #2</h1>
<br>
 <p>These are practice sketches on the Computer Aided Design (CAD) software, Auto Desk 360. To practice CAD, we chose 6 objects to recrate
  in the program. We also had to create our own laptop stand design in AutoDesk 360. It was diffcult to make a stand what was stable and the right 
  size to fit a large laptop. The first design was just a solid block which was too bulky, and if created would be too heavy. The final design
  is stable, light weight and it can fit all types of laptops and tablets.
