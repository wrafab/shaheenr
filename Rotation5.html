<h1>Rotation #5</hl>
<br>
 <p> In this rotation we used the 3D Printer to practice additive design. 
  We used various software including Meshmixer and Makerbot to create our designs.
 We 3D printed an objected with our head using a scanner then a hallow object and a useful 3D printed object.
 The hallow object was one that could not be created by subtractive manufacturing, so I printed a hallow designed cube.
 Also, we had to create a useful object. I printed a spinning top.
