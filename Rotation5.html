<h1>Rotation #5</hl>
<br>
 <p> First we learned about three type of manufacturing: additive, subtractive and formative, and the charactistics of each.
  In this rotation we used the 3D Printer to practice additive design. 
  We used various types of software including Meshmixer and Makerbot to create and print our designs.
 We 3D printed an object with our head on it using a body scanner, and connected it to a base such as a pedestal. 
  The hallow object was one that could not be created by subtractive manufacturing, so I printed a hallow designed cube with additive manufacturing on the 3D Printer.
  I need to make sure the hollowed out area inside was not too large, so the cube kept its strength.
 Also, we needed to create an useful object. I 3D printed a spinning top that spins quite well.
