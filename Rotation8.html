<h1>Rotation #8</hl>
<br>
 <p> This rotation we learned about sewing and embroidery. First using the embroidery machine, I put my intials on a winter hat. I had to 
 clamp the hat down with the proper backing. I used two layers of backing, one was to make the stiching of the embroidery machine stay, and the 
 the other went over the stiching to make sure it was not itchy to wear. Also, this rotation I made a pillow case. I started out by 
 choosing the three fabrics for the pillow case. Then I cut them in one wide, one medium and one short strip. After that I used the sewing machine to 
 sew each segment together, and closed it off on three sides to finish the pillow case. The most diffcult part was to keep the sewing straight and neat 
 while using the sewing machine at a fast speed.</p>
