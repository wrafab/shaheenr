<h1>Rotation #10</hl>
<br>
 <p> Our final prjects had to include four of the different processes that we had learned throughout the semester. I created a battery powered,
  portable designed lamp. It is light weight and can be taken anywhere because of its long lasting battery. The top is able to come off, and even can store items 
  inside. I spent about 3 Digital Engineering Class and about 1 hour working on it after school. In total I spent 4 to 5 hours completing my final
  project. The four process in the project are:
  1) CAD 
  2) Laser cutting 
  3) Electronics 
  4) Sodering 
  First I used the MakerCase software to aid in creating the parts of the cube. Then, I brought the design into the CAD software CorelDraw. 
  In Corel Draw I bitmapped the design, and centered it on all six sides of the cube. After designing the pieces, I used 1/8 inch wood on the 
  laser cutter, and cut ou the design.
