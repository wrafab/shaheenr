<h1>Rotation #3</hl>
 <p>
  This rotation I created a T-Shirt with the Garment Printer, a pop socket with the UV Printer and a pencil case with a logo using the 
  Dye Sublimation Printer. The goal of the T-Shirt was to design a shirt that could possibly be produced and sold in nearby stores.
  We used Corel draw to create the designs that would go on each of these objects. For dye sublimation we used a Sawgrass 800 Print. 
  You have to make sure the original image is on a special heat resistant paper, and is an inverted image to make sure the final product is correct.
  Also the sublimation machine can print on a larger area with faster speed than the UV printer.
