<h1>Rotation #3</hl>
 <p>
  This rotation I created a T-Shirt with the Garment Printer, a pop socket with the UV Printer and a pencil case with a logo using the 
  Dye Sublimation Printer. The goal of the T-Shirt was to design a shirt that could possibly be produced and sold in nearby stores.
  We used Corel draw to create the designs that would go on each of these objects.
