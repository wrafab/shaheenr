<h1>Rotation #6</hl>

 <p> 
  Using CorelDraw I created designs for the front, and back of the skateboard. I used the laser cutter to engrave these designs from CorelDraw 
  on to the skateboard wood. To create the board itself I had to use glue to put 7 pieces of wood together. 
  Each piece of wood has its own grain some provide for flex and some provide more strength to the skateboard. 
  To create the bend of the skateboard I used a vaccum bag to bend the skateboard while the glue was drying. Finally, once the board was dry and shaped 
  properly, I put a shiney coating on the wood to finish the wood.
