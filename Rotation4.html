<h1>Rotation #4</hl>
<br>
 <p>
  This roation we used the laser cutter to create a clock, bookermark and connectable shapes. For software we used Coreldraw to create designs with cutting and engraving on the cutter.
  To make the connectable objects I measured the thickness of the cardboard used, and then made the gaps in the design the same width so they could fit.
  For each object we used different materials in the laser cutter including cardboard, wood and metal. We had to set the design to hairline to cut, and any other thicknes would just engrave.
  With the laser cutter, I used the rotary  attachment to spell my name on a water bottle. For the clock project, once we used the laser cutter to cut out the clock shape we had to fit the hands
  and the battery of the clock on to the wooden frame.
