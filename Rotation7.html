<br>
 <p> During this week, we learned about sodering and electronics. First we learned each of the different parts in a cricut and their symbols.
  Resistors limit the flow of electricty in the cricut. LED or Light Emitting Diode transfers the electrcity into light. Switch turns on and off 
  the flow of electrcity. The multimeter is a tool used to measure the volt and amps of a cricut. Potentiometer is type of resistor that is able to 
  change the resistance by sliding or rotating a dile. A diode has higher resistance in one direction, and lower in the other. Transistors are 
  used to switch the electric power. Capacitors store the electric energy for the cricut. Ohms are the measure of resistance, Amps measure the 
  current of electrcity and Volts measure the voltage. DC stands for direct current, and AC stands for alternate current. DC cricuts are
  all in a linear fashion while AC are in a simultaneous fashion. Here are the practice cricuts I completed.

  In this unit we also practiced sodering. We heated the metal tin up to 750 degrees until it melted. Out job was to create a digital 
  clock by sodering all the componets together.
