 <p>  Digital Fabrication really interested me as an elective course. The Wang Innovation Center (WIC) was recently completed, and had
  many brand new machines to learn about. On the first day of the course we each got into groups of three to solve two different 
  challenges. The first was to reduce the bounce of a golf ball from a high drop with simple household materials, and the second was to make
  the tallest free standing tower possible with just tape and newspaper. Both of these challenges were fun, and we learned about problem solving and 
  team work. 
  Here is a photo of us working:

 <p>Later in the rotation we were introduced to HTML coding on GitHub. We learned how to add text, images, video, change colors and change fonts in a website.
  Many of these tools we learned about in HTML on Github are being used in this very website.
